This repository contains the following:

- FreeDOS 1.1 with all source and tools
- GNU Textutils compiled for FreeDOS, with all source and tools
- A submodule containing the syslinux repository, for memdisk
- A replacement for the BIOS int 0x14 service that actually works
- Glue for building the FreeDOS-related portions of the SDC boot system

This repository serves two main purposes: first, it contains the
original sources for all DOS-related binaries.  Since we don't have any
ability to build them, they aren't really useful, but we still need them
due to licensing requirements.  Second, this repository assembles a
FreeDOS boot environment usable on a USB key for Firmware Diagnostics
and Upgrade Mode.  This is not (currently) used by the SmartOS
distribution.
